# Subscription Cancellation Flow Implementation

## Current Implementation Status

This is a fully functional Next.js application implementing a complete subscription cancellation flow with advanced user experience features and Supabase backend integration.

## What's Built

### âœ… Complete Cancellation Flow
- **Multi-Step Modal Interface**: Dynamic step progression with A/B testing support
- **Advanced Reason Collection**: Structured cancellation reasons with follow-up explanations
- **Interactive Reason Selection**: Dynamic UI that shows/hides options based on selection
- **Follow-up Validation**: Minimum character requirements and price validation for detailed feedback
- **Job Status Questionnaire**: Comprehensive 4-question survey for users who found jobs
- **Downsell Offers**: Variant-based downsell presentations (A/B testing ready)

### âœ… Cancel Reasons System
- **5 Predefined Reasons**: Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
- **Smart Follow-ups**: Context-specific questions based on selected reason
- **Price Input**: Numerical validation for "Too expensive" with real-time feedback
- **Text Validation**: 25-character minimum for detailed feedback with live character counting
- **Interactive UI**: Single-option focus with dynamic show/hide behavior
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Comprehensive Schema**: Users, subscriptions, and cancellations tables with relationships
- **Simplified Cancel Reasons**: Optimized 2-column approach for better maintainability
  - `reason` (enum): Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
  - `explanation` (text): Follow-up details (price for "Too expensive", text for others)
- **Job Questionnaire Fields**: 4 additional columns for detailed job-finding analytics
  - `found_job_with_migratemate` (Yes/No)
  - `roles_applied_count` (0, 1â€“5, 6â€“20, 20+)
  - `companies_emailed_count` (0, 1â€“5, 6â€“20, 20+)
  - `companies_interviewed_count` (0, 1â€“2, 3â€“5, 5+)
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies with user-specific access controls
- **Smart Constraints**: Database-level validation ensuring explanations meet minimum requirements

### API Architecture
- **RESTful Design**: Complete CRUD operations with Next.js App Router
- **Validation Pipeline**: Multi-layer validation (client, server, database)
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with detailed messaging
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod schema validation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Context Providers**: UserContext for global state management
- **Custom Hooks**: `useCancellationFlow` for complex business logic
- **Component Hierarchy**: Modular design with prop drilling prevention
- **State Management**: Optimistic updates with error recovery

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router and Turbopack
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with local development setup
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.11.0 with interceptors
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up database**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase start
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will start on available port (typically 3000, 3001, etc.)

4. **Access the application**:
   - Main app: `http://localhost:PORT`
   - Click "Manage Subscription" â†’ "Cancel Migrate Mate" to test the flow

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.local` file contains local Supabase connection details:
- API URL: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
- Database connection configured with proper authentication keys

## Security Implementation

- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all tables with user-specific access policies
- **Input Validation**: TypeScript interfaces enforce data structure
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses to prevent information leakage

## Feature Breakdown

### Complete Cancellation Flow Steps

1. **Initial Reason Selection** (`CancelReasonStep`)
   - Pre-defined cancellation reasons
   - Job status determination (has job vs. no job)
   - Required field validation

2. **Job Status Branch** (Conditional)
   - If user selected "Found a job" â†’ **Job Questionnaire**
   - If user selected other reasons â†’ **Advanced Reason Collection**

3. **Advanced Reason Collection** (`CancelReasons`)
   - **5 Specific Reasons**: Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
   - **Dynamic Follow-ups**: Context-aware questions based on selection
   - **Smart Validation**: Price input for expensive, 25+ chars for text feedback
   - **Interactive UX**: Single-focus UI with option hiding/showing

4. **Job Questionnaire** (`FoundJobQuestionnaire`) - Alternative Path
   - "Did you find this job with MigrateMate?" (Yes/No)
   - "How many roles did you apply for?" (0, 1â€“5, 6â€“20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you email directly?" (0, 1â€“5, 6â€“20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you interview with?" (0, 1â€“2, 3â€“5, 5+)

5. **Downsell Offer** (`CancelOffer`) - Variant B Only
   - Special pricing offer presentation
   - Accept/decline downsell options

6. **Final Confirmation**
   - Summary of user selections and feedback
   - Complete cancellation processing

### A/B Testing Implementation

- **Variant A**: Initial Reason â†’ Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire â†’ Final
- **Variant B**: Initial Reason â†’ Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire â†’ Downsell â†’ Final
- Secure random assignment using `crypto.getRandomValues()`

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table with basic authentication
users (id, email, created_at)

-- Subscriptions with pricing and status
subscriptions (id, user_id, monthly_price, status, created_at, updated_at)

-- Cancellations with comprehensive tracking
cancellations (
  id, user_id, subscription_id, downsell_variant,
  reason, explanation, accepted_downsell, has_job, created_at,
  -- Job questionnaire fields
  found_job_with_migratemate,
  roles_applied_count,
  companies_emailed_count,
  companies_interviewed_count
)
```
