## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Comprehensive Schema**: Users, subscriptions, and cancellations tables with relationships
- **Simplified Cancel Reasons**: Optimized 2-column approach for better maintainability
  - `reason` (enum): Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
  - `explanation` (text): Follow-up details (price for "Too expensive", text for others)
- **Job Questionnaire Fields**: 4 additional columns for detailed job-finding analytics
  - `found_job_with_migratemate` (Yes/No)
  - `roles_applied_count` (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
  - `companies_emailed_count` (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
  - `companies_interviewed_count` (0, 1–2, 3–5, 5+)
- **Visa Consultation Fields**: 2 additional columns for immigration lawyer assessment
  - `has_immigration_lawyer` (boolean): Whether company provides immigration lawyer
  - `visa_type` (text): Specific visa type user is applying for
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies with user-specific access controls
- **Smart Constraints**: Database-level validation ensuring explanations meet minimum requirements

### API Architecture
- **RESTful Design**: Complete CRUD operations with Next.js App Router
- **Validation Pipeline**: Multi-layer validation (client, server, database)
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with detailed messaging
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod schema validation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Context Providers**: UserContext for global state management
- **Custom Hooks**: `useCancellationFlow` for complex business logic, `useVisaForm` for shared visa functionality
- **Component Hierarchy**: Modular design with prop drilling prevention and expert-level code organization
- **State Management**: Optimistic updates with error recovery
- **Code Organization**: Refactored renderStep function with common props extraction and dedicated step renderers

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router and Turbopack
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with local development setup
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.11.0 with interceptors
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up database**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase start
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will start on available port (typically 3000, 3001, etc.)

4. **Access the application**:
   - Main app: `http://localhost:PORT`
   - Click "Manage Subscription" → "Cancel Migrate Mate" to test the flow

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.local` file contains local Supabase connection details:
- API URL: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
- Database connection configured with proper authentication keys

## Security Implementation

- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all tables with user-specific access policies
- **Input Validation**: TypeScript interfaces enforce data structure
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses to prevent information leakage

## Feature Breakdown

### Complete Cancellation Flow Steps

1. **Initial Reason Selection** (`CancelReasonStep`)
   - Pre-defined cancellation reasons
   - Job status determination (has job vs. no job)
   - Required field validation

2. **Job Status Branch** (Conditional)
   - If user selected "Found a job" → **Job Questionnaire**
   - If user selected other reasons → **Advanced Reason Collection**

3. **Advanced Reason Collection** (`CancelReasons`)
   - **5 Specific Reasons**: Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
   - **Dynamic Follow-ups**: Context-aware questions based on selection
   - **Smart Validation**: Price input for expensive, 25+ chars for text feedback
   - **Interactive UX**: Single-focus UI with option hiding/showing

4. **Job Questionnaire** (`FoundJobQuestionnaire`) - Alternative Path
   - "Did you find this job with MigrateMate?" (Yes/No)
   - "How many roles did you apply for?" (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you email directly?" (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you interview with?" (0, 1–2, 3–5, 5+)

5. **Job Success Feedback** (`CancelHow`) - For Job Found Path
   - Detailed feedback collection on how MigrateMate helped
   - Database persistence with prefill functionality

6. **Visa Consultation** - For Job Found Path
   - **CancellationVisa**: For users who found job through MigrateMate
   - **CancellationVisaNoJob**: For users who found job independently
   - Immigration lawyer availability assessment (Yes/No)
   - Visa type specification with validation

7. **Downsell Offer** (`CancelOffer`) - Variant B Only
   - Special pricing offer presentation
   - Accept/decline downsell options

8. **Final Confirmation**
   - Multiple completion paths based on user journey
   - **JobCancelComplete**: For job-found users with visa sorted
   - **CancelCompleteHelp**: For users needing visa assistance
   - **CancelComplete**: Standard cancellation completion
   - Complete cancellation processing with database reset functionality

### A/B Testing Implementation

- **Variant A**: Initial Reason → Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire → Job Feedback → Visa Consultation → Final
- **Variant B**: Initial Reason → Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire → Job Feedback → Visa Consultation → Downsell → Final
- Secure random assignment using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- Dynamic step calculation based on user path and variant assignment

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table with basic authentication
users (id, email, created_at)

-- Subscriptions with pricing and status
subscriptions (id, user_id, monthly_price, status, created_at, updated_at)
