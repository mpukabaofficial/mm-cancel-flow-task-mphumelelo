- **Simplified Cancel Reasons**: Optimized 2-column approach for better maintainability
  - `reason` (enum): Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
  - `explanation` (text): Follow-up details (price for "Too expensive", text for others)
- **Job Questionnaire Fields**: 4 additional columns for detailed job-finding analytics
  - `found_job_with_migratemate` (Yes/No)
  - `roles_applied_count` (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
  - `companies_emailed_count` (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
  - `companies_interviewed_count` (0, 1–2, 3–5, 5+)
- **Visa Consultation Fields**: 2 additional columns for immigration lawyer assessment
  - `has_immigration_lawyer` (boolean): Whether company provides immigration lawyer
  - `visa_type` (text): Specific visa type user is applying for
- **Smart Downsell Tracking**: Prevents double-dipping with `accepted_downsell` tracking and automatic variant switching
- **Dynamic Variant Assignment**: Updates user variant to 'A' after downsell usage to skip future offers
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies with user-specific access controls

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router and Turbopack
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with local development setup
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.11.0 with interceptors
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

## Database Seeding and Supabase Usage

### Automatic Setup Process

The `npm run db:setup` command performs the following:

1. **Start Supabase**: Launches local Supabase instance with PostgreSQL, API server, and Studio dashboard
2. **Run Migrations**: Applies all database migrations in order:
   - Initial schema (users, subscriptions, cancellations tables)
   - Row Level Security policies 
   - Additional fields for job questionnaire and visa consultation
   - Subscription cancellation fields
   - RLS policy fixes for service role access
3. **Seed Data**: Automatically seeds the database with test users and subscriptions:
   - **3 Test Users**: user1@example.com, user2@example.com, user3@example.com with fixed UUIDs
   - **3 Subscriptions**: $25/month and $29/month plans in active status
   - **Pricing Format**: All prices stored in cents (2500 = $25.00)

### Supabase Services

The local Supabase instance provides:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 54322
- **API**: RESTful API on port 54321  
- **Studio**: Database management UI on port 54323
- **Auth**: Authentication service (configured but not used in this demo)
- **Storage**: File storage service
- **Functions**: Edge functions support

### Database Configuration

- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all tables with policies that allow service role access
- **Service Role Access**: App uses `supabaseAdmin` client with service role key to bypass RLS for demo purposes
- **Data Persistence**: All user interactions and cancellation data are stored in PostgreSQL
- **Validation**: Server-side validation ensures data integrity with Zod schemas

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.local` file contains local Supabase connection details:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

These are default local development keys that work out of the box with no additional configuration required.

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Enabled on All Tables**: users, subscriptions, cancellations
- **Service Role Access**: Policies allow service role to access all data for demo purposes
- **Future-Ready**: Policies structured to support authenticated user access when auth is implemented
- **Policy Structure**: Uses `auth.role()` checks to differentiate between service role and authenticated users

### Input Validation
- **Client-Side**: TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas prevent invalid data entry
- **Server-Side**: API routes validate all inputs with detailed error messages
- **Database-Side**: PostgreSQL constraints and enum types ensure data integrity
- **UUID Validation**: All IDs validated as proper UUIDs before database queries

### Error Handling
- **Sanitized Responses**: Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- **Structured Errors**: Consistent error response format across all APIs
- **Validation Details**: Clear feedback on what fields failed validation and why

## Feature Breakdown

### Complete Cancellation Flow Steps

1. **Initial Reason Selection** (`CancelReasonStep`)
   - Pre-defined cancellation reasons
   - Job status determination (has job vs. no job)
   - Required field validation

2. **Job Status Branch** (Conditional)
   - If user selected "Found a job" → **Job Questionnaire**
   - If user selected other reasons → **Advanced Reason Collection**

3. **Advanced Reason Collection** (`CancelReasons`)
   - **5 Specific Reasons**: Too expensive, Platform not helpful, Not enough relevant jobs, Decided not to move, Other
   - **Dynamic Follow-ups**: Context-aware questions based on selection
   - **Smart Validation**: Price input for expensive, 25+ chars for text feedback
   - **Interactive UX**: Single-focus UI with option hiding/showing

4. **Job Questionnaire** (`FoundJobQuestionnaire`) - Alternative Path
   - "Did you find this job with MigrateMate?" (Yes/No)
   - "How many roles did you apply for?" (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you email directly?" (0, 1–5, 6–20, 20+)
   - "How many companies did you interview with?" (0, 1–2, 3–5, 5+)

5. **Job Success Feedback** (`CancelHow`) - For Job Found Path
   - Detailed feedback collection on how MigrateMate helped
   - Database persistence with prefill functionality

6. **Visa Consultation** - For Job Found Path
   - **CancellationVisa**: For users who found job through MigrateMate
   - **CancellationVisaNoJob**: For users who found job independently
   - Immigration lawyer availability assessment (Yes/No)
   - Visa type specification with validation

7. **Smart Downsell Offer** (`CancelOffer`) - Variant B Only
   - $10 discount offer presentation with dynamic pricing calculation
   - Accept/decline downsell options with double-dip prevention
   - Automatic variant switching to prevent repeated offers

8. **Final Confirmation**
   - Multiple completion paths based on user journey with responsive design
   - **JobCancelComplete**: For job-found users with visa sorted (no back button on mobile)
   - **CancelCompleteHelp**: For users needing visa assistance (no back button on mobile)
   - **CancelComplete**: Standard cancellation completion (no back button on mobile)
   - Complete cancellation processing with database reset functionality

### A/B Testing Implementation

- **Variant A**: Initial Reason → Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire → Job Feedback → Visa Consultation → Final
- **Variant B**: Initial Reason → Advanced Reason Collection/Job Questionnaire → Job Feedback → Visa Consultation → Downsell → Final
- **Smart Variant Switching**: Users who accept downsell offers are automatically switched to Variant A for future cancellation attempts
- Secure random assignment using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- Dynamic step calculation based on user path and variant assignment
- Downsell usage tracking prevents users from seeing offers multiple times

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table with basic authentication
users (id, email, created_at)

-- Subscriptions with pricing and status
subscriptions (
  id, user_id, monthly_price, status, 
  has_cancelled, cancelled_at, expires_at,
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- Cancellations with comprehensive tracking
cancellations (
  id, user_id, subscription_id, downsell_variant,
  reason, explanation, accepted_downsell, has_job, created_at,
  -- Job questionnaire fields
  found_job_with_migratemate,
  roles_applied_count,
  companies_emailed_count,
  companies_interviewed_count,
  -- Visa consultation fields
  has_immigration_lawyer,
  visa_type
)
```

## Testing the Application

### Cancellation Flow Compliance
✅ **Mobile + Desktop Design**: Responsive design matches Figma specifications

### Manual Testing Flow
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Manage Subscription" to expand  
3. Click "Cancel Migrate Mate" (red button)
4. Complete the cancellation flow:
   - **Job Found Path**: Select "Found a job" → Fill job questionnaire → Provide feedback on how MM helped → Visa consultation → Final step
   - **No Job Path**: Select other reason → Choose specific reason + provide explanation → Final step
   - **Visa Paths**: 
     - If found job with MM: CancellationVisa component
     - If found job without MM: CancellationVisaNoJob component
   - Test different reasons to see dynamic follow-up questions
   - Verify validation requirements (25+ chars, valid price inputs, visa type required)
   - Observe step progression, data persistence, and reset functionality

### API Testing
- All endpoints available at `/api/cancellations` and `/api/subscriptions`
- Database operations can be verified via Supabase dashboard
- Console logs show request/response details during development

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port 3000 in Use
If you see "Port 3000 is in use, using available port 3001", this is normal. The app will automatically use the next available port.

#### Supabase Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if Supabase is running
npx supabase status

# If not running, restart setup
npm run db:setup
```

#### Permission Issues with .next/trace
This is a Windows-specific issue that doesn't affect functionality. The app will still work correctly despite the permission warning.

#### Database Reset
If you need to reset the database completely:
```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

#### Missing Dependencies
If you encounter missing dependency errors:
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start Supabase only (without reset)
npx supabase start

# Reset database with fresh data
npx supabase db reset  

# Check Supabase status
npx supabase status

# Stop Supabase
npx supabase stop

# View database in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:54323
```

### Environment Verification

To verify your setup is working correctly:

1. **Database Connection**: Check `http://localhost:54323` for Supabase Studio
2. **API Endpoints**: Test `http://localhost:3000/api/users` should return seeded users
3. **Cancellation API**: Test `http://localhost:3000/api/cancellations` should return empty array initially
