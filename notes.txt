// how to migrate the current migration
  
  
  1. Read the migration file - Used the Read tool to examine the existing schema in supabase/migrations/20240101000001_initial_schema.sql
  2. Added the ALTER TABLE statement - Used the Edit tool to add the following SQL after the CREATE TABLE statement:
  -- Add has_job column to cancellations table
  ALTER TABLE cancellations
  ADD COLUMN has_job BOOLEAN;
  3. Reset the database - Ran npx supabase db reset to apply all migrations from scratch, which:
    - Recreated the database
    - Applied the updated migration file including the new column
    - Restarted the containers
  4. Verified services were running - Checked npx supabase status to confirm the database was accessible
